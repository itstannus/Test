	/*This is a simple straight forward method to find the 
	 * triplet. The most common examples are : 
	 * 3, 4, 5 right triangles
	 * 5, 12, 13 right triangles
	 * 7, 24, 25 right triangles
	 * 8, 15, 17 triangles 
	 * and any of the triplets are multiple of any of the above triplets 
	 * Based on the above information 
	 * if we try the last of hte above triplet  with a common multiple
	 * the according to the given condition 
	 * 8k+17k+15k=1000 => 40k=1000 => k=25 
	 * so the triplet is (200,375,425) which results into the product being
